# LanPlayMeetup
Lan Play Meetup is a matchmaking website for lan play, it includes:  
-Rooms for games which you can join  
-Anonymous public chatrooms in each game room to discuss which server to play a game  
-No ads  
-Messages on the public chatrooms are deleted after 24 hours  
-No registration required, all is anonymous  
-Only 2 cookies, one for the automatically generated anon username for the chat(example: anon-1fa12d) and other for socker.io, the library that powers the chat  
-There is a 10 minutes timer when you join a room, you are kicked when that timer reach 0, you can reset the timer to 10 minutes whit a button in any moment, this is done to prevent someone from entering a room, leave that in a tab in the browser forgotten and being counted in the player count in the room, this way, people that not longer actively want to play, are kicked and only ppl that currently want to play remain in the room
